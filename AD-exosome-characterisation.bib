  abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.
Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

  abstract = {Technical biases are introduced in omics data sets during data generation and interfere with the ability to study biological mechanisms. Several normalization approaches have been proposed to minimize the effects of such biases, but fluctuations in the electrospray current during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry gradients cause local and sample-specific bias not considered by most approaches. Here we introduce a software named NormalyzerDE that includes a generic retention time (RT)segmented approach compatible with a wide range of global normalization approaches to reduce the effects of time-resolved bias. The software offers straightforward access to multiple normalization methods, allows for data set evaluation and normalization quality assessment as well as subsequent or independent differential expression analysis using the empirical Bayes Limma approach. When evaluated on two spike-in data sets the RT-segmented approaches outperformed conventional approaches by detecting more peptides (8-36\%) without loss of precision. Furthermore, differential expression analysis using the Limma approach consistently increased recall (2-35\%) compared to analysis of variance. The combination of RTnormalization and Limma was in one case able to distinguish 108\% (2597 vs 1249) more spike-in peptides compared to traditional approaches. NormalyzerDE provides widely usable tools for performing normalization and evaluating the outcome and makes calculation of subsequent differential expression statistics straightforward. The program is available as a web server at http://quantitativeproteomics.org/normalyzerde.},
